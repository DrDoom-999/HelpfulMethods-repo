# HelpfulMethods-repo

Hello World!

This project should help others by offering lots of useful stuff,
e.g. methods like "toStringArray()" (instead of splitting a string into chars, sometimes you wanna have an array of strings) 
or "searchInString()" (searching for a specific char in a string).
Moreover, there are other methods that should help you solve daily problems while programming.
New methods will be added in the future (if I have the time to do that ;-)).
