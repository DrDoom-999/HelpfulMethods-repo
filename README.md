# HelpfulMethods-repo

Hello World!

The idea of this project is to write useful methods / classes to make programming easier.
For example, there is a method called "searchInString", where you can search for a specific
char in a string.

Moreover, there are other methods that should help you solve problems while programming.
New methods will be added in the future.



Some information to notice before using the code:

1. I am not a professional software engineer, so there will be some parts of my code 
   that professionals will maybe consider "unprofessional" or where they think: "this is not how we do it".
   I am thankful for any advice that you give me!

2. I am pretty new to Git / GitHub, so please don't expect to much expertise from me :-). 

3. I am busy at the moment, so I will not always be online or see new pull requests. 
   
4. If you have any good ideas for methods that are helpful during dialy coding or for special problems, 
   you can contribute to this project! (just have to figure out, how i can add your code in GitHub ;-))
